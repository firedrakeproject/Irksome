This directory contains two demos for the mixed form of the wave equation using the TimeStepper class.
We have one demo doing a fully implicit Gauss-Legendre method that exactly conserves energy but requires a stage-coupled linear solve at each time step.
We compare this to the explicit time stepping widget with pseudo-energy-conserving methods, which require many more stages, but these can be computed independently by only inverting a mass matrix.
